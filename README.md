**RyanD524/RyanD524** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->
I primarily work in C++ and python! But I love learning new languages.
I also am developing my own language called [BlueScript](https://github.com/MayD524/CBluescirpt)


Most of these repos are kinda old, but I may go back and refactor most of them :)<br>
I also am always looking for fun coding/programing challenges and always looking for people to work with!

I'm a backend engineer with a fair amount of frontend experience. I've worked with hardware, server on prem and cloud in enterprise, small business and personal contexts.<br>
I've also taught computer science specifically C++ and Python; Along with data science, full stack development, and hardware development.
